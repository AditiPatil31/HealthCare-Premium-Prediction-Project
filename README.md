## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a Machine Learning system to estimate health insurance premiums based on age, BMI, smoking habits, medical history, and insurance plan type.

Dataset size: **50,000 records**

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

✔ Large dataset (50K records)  
✔ Outlier detection using box plots  
✔ Feature engineering & encoding  
✔ Multicollinearity handled using VIF  
✔ Error-analysis driven improvements  
✔ Age-based model segmentation  
✔ Hybrid modeling (Linear Regression + XGBoost)  
✔ End-to-end deployment with Streamlit  

---

## 🧠 Modeling Strategy

After error analysis, customers were segmented based on age:

- **Linear Regression** → General age group  
- **XGB Regressor** → Young age group  

This segmentation improved predictive performance.
